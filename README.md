# Running Minecraft on a Raspberry Pi
A repository to house findings, tutorials on setting up, and scripts.

## Introduction

I recently bought a Raspberry Pi kit from Canakit and really had no idea of what I wanted to do with it just yet. I decided to pick up a small project to familiarize myself with the little computer and become more comfortable with it to tackle larger projects. So, as I was searching for project ideas, I came across a tutorial on setting up a Minecraft server on the Pi. Naturally, I gravitated towards that project first, as I love Minecraft and have for years. So, this respository will act as a tutorial, as well as a space for me to keep meticulous notes on the process for me and for others to work off of.

## Round 1 - Setting up the Raspberry Pi

In the [kit](http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-3-ultimate-kit.html) I bought was a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with a quad-core 1.2 GHz processor, 1 GB of RAM, and onboard WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. It's definitely not the best computer to run a Minecraft server on seriously, but it's enough for a few friends and yourself to play on. The kit included heatsinks with thermal tape, a clear-case to fit around the Pi, an HDMI cable to connect to a display, a 32 GB micro SD card pre-loaded with NOOBS (New Out Of the Box Software), an SD card reader that you can connect to your computer (this comes in handy later on!), and loads of other things to get started on projects.

The Canakit came with instructions on getting Raspbian (a Linux distro based on Debian that was made specifically with the Raspberry Pi in mind) installed on the RPI.
